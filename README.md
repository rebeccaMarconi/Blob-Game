## Blob-Game
Final Project; A Game of Blobs

In this game, the user guides a blob that seeks to absorb the ellipses that appear on the screen. The user must grow the blob big enough to envelop the ellipses by clicking their cursor over the blob, then they lead the blob to the ellipse by moving the cursor. Each time the blob captures an ellipse, the point meter on the top left of the screen will grow. However, if the user brings the blob over the center of the ellipse before it is big enough, the point meter will drop to zero. 

This is a skill game meant to go on for as long as you are able, play alone or compete to beat your friends' scores.
